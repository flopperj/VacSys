VacSys
======

## SCENARIO
-----------
In this assignment we will be developing a vaccination allocation system called VacSys. This 
program will take in requests for vaccinations, either in batch format in a CSV Ô¨Åle or as an individual 
request. The system will calculate a priority value for each request, and store the request in a priority 
queue. When a vaccination is available, the system can remove the next request from the priority 
queue and return it to the user.
